## Problem
Crypto protocols, especially new ones, have a lot of problems in maintaining the value of their tokens. To help to solve this problem - various staging and farming protocols are getting created, to increase incentivize users holding protocol tokens.

Although problem is partially solved by existing solutions, still, lots of market players are trying to create their own implementations of staking and farming over and over again.

From our experience protocols are implementing their unique solutions for several reasons:
Wants to provide rewards for staking a single token
Wants this incentivization to be fully embeddable into their dApp/website/launchpad
Are not big enough to get accepted into well-known farms

## Solution
Independent stacking/farming protocol allows for anyone (permissionless) to create pools, accepting any ERC20 token to be staked and any other or even the same ERC20 token to be harvested as an incentives. With schedules, reward amounts, etc. being controlled by pool owners.
Protocols would ensure that promised rewards will be paid (no rug-pulling!).
And the best part - free/open source staking/farming widget you can integrate to any web based solution of yours.

## Applying for bounties
- RedStone Oracles Bounty - used their API to display $ values
- Gnosis chain - deployed contract to chiado chain and made it work with dApp
